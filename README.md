## ✅ Objective

Build a simple full-stack Task Manager app using:

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite (instead of PostgreSQL), RESTful API.
- Frontend: React (with plain CSS), running inside a Next.js-like component structure.

> ⚠️ Note: PostgreSQL was replaced with SQLite locally for simplicity and easier setup. Logic remains the same.
